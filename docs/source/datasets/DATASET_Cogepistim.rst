COGEPISTIM database (U/C)
***************************

Description
===========

This dataset includes iEEG recordings and imaging data of 300 patients retrospectively collected from different research protocols:
	
	* F-TRACT: `The Functional Brain Tractography Project <https://f-tract.eu/>`_.
	* ISD SEEG: `Evaluation of the Risk of Cognitive Deficit After Surgery of Epilepsy by Dynamic Spectral Imaging (ISD) of the Cognitive Functions in Patients Explored in StereoElectroEncephaloGraphy <https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03094312>`_. 
	* EPISTIM: `Epileptogenic Zone's Cartography by Quantification of EEG's Signal and Intracerebral Stimulation <https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02844374>`_.
	* MAPCOG-SEEG: `Atlas of Human Cognition by SEEG <https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03644732>`_.




BIDS database designed for the COGEPISTIM protocol. The database contains imaging (T1, T2, FLAIR, CT) and SEEG (baseline, seizure, stimulation) data with associated electrode coordinates (computed from IntrAnat). Clinical/demographic information is limited to age groups. Data were imported and pseudonymized using BIDS Manager.
