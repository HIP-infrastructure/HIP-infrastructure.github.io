	**Desktops on the HIP.** *Desktops are persistent environments used to run applications from the App Catalog.*

About this tutorial
====================

The objective of this guide is to introduce Desktops, which operate as remote computers and are typically used to run the applications available in the App Catalog.
This guide comes with a video showing how to manage Desktops (create, display, pause/resume and switch between Desktops) and run one or several applications simultaneously.
It also explains essential rules regarding data access and persistence inside a Desktop environment. However, it does not cover the uses of the various applications
available in the App Catalog. In this perspective, the *HIP APPS* and *HIP TUTORIALS* sections accessible in the table of contents contain documentation, tutorials and
links to external resources.

Use Desktops and run applications from the App Catalog
=======================================================

Desktops are remote virtual computers running on a secure infrastructure where HIP users can run applications from the App Catalog
to work on their data. 
Desktops operate similarly to a personal computer and support most common features (drag and drop, full screen mode, clipboard, virtual keyboard).
Any application from the App Catalog, regardless if it is GUI- or CLI- based, can be run in a Desktop environment.
Desktops are available in all 3 HIP spaces: the Private, Collaborative and Public spaces, and work in a similar way.

Desktops and data persistence
-----------------------------

Once it has been initiated, a Desktop will persist until it is manually terminated. HIP users can safely log off and/or close their web browser. 
Pending Desktops will remain unaltered and accessible for later use.
