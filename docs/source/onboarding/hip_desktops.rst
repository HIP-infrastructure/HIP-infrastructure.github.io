Use desktops and run applications
**********************************

Desktops operate as remote virtual computers where HIP users can run applications from the App Catalog to process data located in their Private Space. 
Once it has been initiated, a Desktop will persist until it is manually terminated. HIP users can safely log off and/or close their web browser.
Pending Desktops will remain unaltered and accessible for later use.
  
The procedure to open a Desktop and start applications from the App Catalog is illustrated in
the following video (2'30''), from the :doc:`How to use Desktops and run applications from the App Catalog</guides/GUIDE_How_to_use_Desktops_and_run_applications_from_the_App_Catalog>` guide:
