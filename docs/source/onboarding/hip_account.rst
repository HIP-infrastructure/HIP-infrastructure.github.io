Once your EBRAINS account has been activated, you can apply for a HIP account sending
an `e-mail to HIP support team <mailto:support@thehip.app?subject=HIP%20account%20request%20>`_ with the following information (items marked with an asterisk are mandatory):

.. admonition:: Affiliations and HIP groups

   All HIP users are also member of at least one group corresponding to pre-identified institutions
   listed in the table of :ref:`HIP groups <list_identified_hip_groups>`.
   Affiliations are cross-checked during the registration process.
	
Once your application has been validated, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to your institutional e-mail and you will be added to the HIP group
on EBRAINS so you can `log in the HIP <https://thehip.app/login>`_ using your EBRAINS credentials.
