.. admonition:: Data Transfer Agreement (DTA)

   A Data Transfer Agreement has to be signed between the participating institution and the CHUV prior to any data transfer taking place.

The HIP user uploading data to the HIP qualify as Data Controller for the corresponding data.
It is the Data Controller responsibility to secure proper data pseudonymised/anonymised prior to the transfer, depending on the DTA.
Data can only be uploaded in the Private Space of the HIP user doing the transfer.
HIP users also have read and write access to the shared folder of each HIP group they belong to.
The shared folder is named according to the corresponding HIP group.

There are currently 2 solutions for uploading data to the HIP as explained in the :doc:`How to prepare and upload data to the HIP</guides/GUIDE_How_to_prepare_and_upload_data_to_the_HIP>` guide.
It is advised to set up a synchronized folder using the Nextcloud client as illustrated in the following video (2'27''):
