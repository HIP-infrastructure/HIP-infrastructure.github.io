   Applications running in a Desktop environment have access to your Private Space data under the */home/<HIP_USER>/nextcloud* directory.
   Any data and/or configuration file outside of this directory will be lost when the application or desktop are closed.
   This is the only persistent directory as it is tied to the HIP user's Private Space at application startup.
   **Make sure you are always working within the /home/<HIP_USER>/nextcloud directory when using applications**.
