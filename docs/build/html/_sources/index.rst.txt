The `HIP <https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/medicine/human-intracerebral-eeg-platform/>`_ is an open-source platform designed for large scale and optimized collection, storage, curation, sharing
and analysis of multiscale Human iEEG data at the international level. The HIP covers the entire field of iEEG-based research; i.e. multi-scale investigation of cognition, consciousness, connectomics and related disorders.

The HIP is also fully integrated in `EBRAINS <https://ebrains.eu/>`_ , a sustainable European Research Infrastructure providing tools and services in brain
research and brain-inspired technologies created by the EU-funded `Human Brain Project <https://www.humanbrainproject.eu>`_.
The HIP will enable the use of EBRAINS HPC resources and will offer links to other EBRAINS services, like the `Knowledge Graph <https://kg.ebrains.eu/>`_ and the `Human Brain Atlases <https://ebrains.eu/services#category1>`_. 
In line with the `FAIR principles <https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>`_ , it will fully respect ethics and data privacy regulations, and optimise end-user access management.
