Dashboard
----------

The Dashboard gives an overview of the opened Desktops and BIDS databases available in all 3 HIP spaces, namely, :doc:`the Private Space, the Collaborative
Space and the Public Space </guides/GUIDE_How_to_use_the_HIP_spaces_and_share_data_with_other_users>`.
Note that only the Private Space is available during the Beta phase. 

From the side navigation menu, you can also access the following items:

	* App Catalog: A comprehensive list of all the applications made available to the HIP users so they can process their data. 
	* Documentation: Links to the :doc:`user documentation <../index>`, `technical documentation <https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/hip-doc>`_ and `HIP website <https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/medicine/human-intracerebral-eeg-platform/>`_.
	* Desktops: :doc:`Desktops </guides/GUIDE_How_to_use_Desktops_and_run_applications_from_the_App_Catalog>` operate
	  as remote virtual computers where HIP users can run applications from the App Catalog to process 
	  data :doc:`uploaded</guides/GUIDE_How_to_prepare_and_upload_data_to_the_HIP>` or :ref:`shared in their Private Space <the_private_space>`.
	* BIDS: :ref:`The BIDS importer <BIDS_importer>` is a step-by-step tool that can be used to import raw data into a BIDS database.

Files
------

The Files service lets you browse the folders and files available in your Private Space.
You can upload data to your Private Space by simply dragging and dropping files into the file browser, although it is advised to
upload data using the Nexclout client as explained in the :doc:`How to prepare and upload data to the HIP </guides/GUIDE_How_to_prepare_and_upload_data_to_the_HIP>` guide.
The Private Space also contains the shared folders of the :ref:`HIP groups <list_identified_hip_groups>` you are a member of. 

Talk
-----

The Talk service lets you discuss with other HIP users, group members, and the HIP support team.
The Talk service is not yet available.
