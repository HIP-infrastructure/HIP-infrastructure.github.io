	**Collaborative Project.** *Create a new Collaborative Project and share data with HIP users.*

About this tutorial
====================

The purpose of this guide is to provide an overview of Collaborative Projects, including their objectives and primary utilization.
It comes with a video tutorial demonstrating key operations such as creating a new Collaborative Project, adding members, and transferring and processing data using the integrated tools.
It also outlines :ref:`crucial guidelines <the_collaborative_space>` for creating and using Collaborative Projects.
However, it does not delve into the specific applications of certain services, such as :doc:`Desktops </guides/GUIDE_How_to_use_Desktops_and_run_applications_from_the_App_Catalog>`
or :doc:`BIDS tools </guides/GUIDE_How_to_convert_data_to_BIDS_format>`, as these are covered in separate guides.


What are Collaborative Projects
================================

A Collaborative Project represents a work group assigned to a research project, contributing through data sharing and/or processing.

The HIP user initiating a Collaborative Project assumes the role of Project Leader, concurrently becoming the :ref:`Data Controller <data_controller_responsabilities>` for that project.
The Project Leader holds the authority to add or remove HIP users from any projects under their responsibility.

Members of a project, referred to as Collaborators, are granted access to a set of services enabling them to transfer data and/or documents from their Private Space to the project’s dedicated space.
This data transfer can only be performed using HIP’s integrated tools. Once shared, the data can be collectively managed and processed using project-specific :doc:`BIDS tools </guides/GUIDE_How_to_convert_data_to_BIDS_format>`
and :doc:`Desktops </guides/GUIDE_How_to_use_Desktops_and_run_applications_from_the_App_Catalog>`.

Collaborative projects are the only way to share data between users from different institutions.
